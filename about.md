I'm living in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I tend to think about machine learning, building engineering teams, politics and sports.

I like to mentor. I have taught graduate courses on programming and data science at Duke University and tutored people professionally at all stages of their careers.

At various times in the past I have run commercial software teams, executive'd at a fortune 5, founded startups, dabbled in academia, and worked as a software developer at places ranging from Microsoft to 2-person startups.  I'm currently leading technology at Onda.
