Really focusing on simplifying.  My last year has been very distracted between shutting down the startup, new job, new house, kids sleeping patterns, etc.  Hoping to find some rythm with the following:

- Settling in at Optum.  Trying to map out the best way to speng my next 12 months there.

- Forcing myself to write.  Trying to internalize (again) some of [Mike Munger's thoughts](http://chronicle.com/article/10-Tips-on-How-to-Write-Less/124268) on this.

- Spending time with my wife and kids.  Every day.  With my phone off.

- Moving in to our new house -- unpacking and all of the projects that come with a new space.
