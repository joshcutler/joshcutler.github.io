Trying to safely keep all the plates spinning through the pandemic:

- I am really trying to not just put our lives on pause but still be safe.  That means being creative with the kids and my wife on how/what we can do.

- Growing my and my teams' role at work.  The team is kicking butt, so now I need to figure out how we can do more and keep having fun.

- Enjoying as much outdoor time as possible before the snow hits.

- Cooking a lot more.  Really trying to find things that are fun for the adults but our 2 and 5 year old will eat so we don't have two seperate menus.
