Just taken the reigns at [Deep Machine](https://www.deepmachine.com).  Splitting time between growing that and getting my personal life in balance.

- Finding more clients that Deep Machine can help.

- Forcing myself to write.  Trying to internalize (again) some of [Mike Munger's thoughts](http://chronicle.com/article/10-Tips-on-How-to-Write-Less/124268) on this.

- Working on getting into good enough shape that I can jump back into BJJ.

- Spending time with my wife and son.  Every day.  With my phone off.

The above writing isn't of much use unless I find an audience.  If you are looking for speakers / instructors in any area that Deep Machine is investing in, please reach out!
