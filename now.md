Trying to safely keep all the plates spinning through the pandemic:

- I am really trying to not just put our lives on pause but still be safe.  That means being creative with the kids and my wife on how/what we can do.

- Starting a new role as the Chief Data Scientist at UnitedHealthcare.

- Planning the new garden and outdoor spaces to enjoy this summer.

- Spinning up lots of side projects.  Keeping the technical skills sharp and keeping myself sane.
