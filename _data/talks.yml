      title: "Chatbots: From POC to Production"
      brief-description: "In this talk we will discuss three key considerations for progressing your chatbots from POC to running in production: scalability, managing the unhappy path, and making sure that you can get better over time.  We will consider scalability ossues ranging from the chatbot machinery itself to backend fulfillment services to increased engagement from your users.  The environment in which you develop your chatbot, by necessity, will represent only a small fraction of the interactions that real world users will present and we will discuss how to think about bridging that gap.  Finally, we will talk about how to ensure that you are capturing and utilizing the interactions that your production environment will capture toensure that your chatbot is both successful during this transition and getting better over time."

      title: "Delivering with Machine Learning"
      brief-description: In this upcoming session, Josh Cutler, VP & Sr. Distinguished Engineer for AI Platforms & Transformation Team at Optum, will talk through the “how” of implementing machine learning.  While effectively training machine learning models can be a difficult undertaking in its own right, deploying them and realizing their value is equally important. This talk will discuss how to develop and deliver machine learning technologies into production in a scalable and repeatable manner. Using real examples throughout, we will step through the considerations for training, managing and ultimately deploying machine learning models into working software systems.

      title: Building Expert Systems Using Artificial Intelligence
      brief-description: In this episode, we are joined by Josh Cutler, VP & Sr. Distinguished Engineer for AI Platforms & Transformation Team at Optum. Josh shared with us his 15+ years of experience in applying data and intelligence to solve hard business problems. I really liked Josh's definition of the application of AI being, "How can we help computers make good decisions". This cuts to the core of why we are building these systems and what the outcome should be.  Besides the applications Josh is building with his team today, he shared with us how he got into the field, the startups he founded, and how Microsoft was actually ahead of their time in this space with their Live Labs initiative and so much more. Enjoy!
